I'll start by sharing examples of different blogs that I think demonstrate a few creative ways to format and publish data science content. Then I'll review some of the cool things you can do with `{distill}` to customize your own beautiful posts.\n\n\nData science blogging has become pretty darn popular in recent years, and for good reason. It can help you to build your online professional profile, enhance your communication skills, stay atop the latest and greatest trends and tools, connect with other data scientists, and even solicit feedback from those in the community.\n\nBut arguably one of the most valuable reasons to blog is to get a whole lot better at doing whatever it is you want to write about. You've probably heard some version of the saying, *\"The best way to learn something is to teach it to others\"* -- not only do I find this to be true of myself, but there's also science^[This is sometimes referred to as the Protégé Effect or the Feynman Learning Technique. You can learn a bit more from [@Nestojko2014protege] and [@Ambio2020Feynman]] to back this up!\n\nStill, getting started can be a bit intimidating (I'm only doing this for the first time now myself). It an attempt to make it a little less so for the next blogger-to-be, I have tried to gather some ideas, instructions, and inspiration to get things going.

Adding a distill blog to your personal website \n\n***Disclaimer:** A lot of the following content (sections III & IV) is just a compilation of excellent existing resources. I learn by repeating things (usually many times), so taking the time to type out code/YAML headers has been helpful, albeit not at all novel. See a list of referenced resources at the bottom of this post.*\n\nIf you have not yet made a distill site, there are *many* great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0SZiVvp32UTJ9sK_yVjI8ou6pVdFRXsY2236tiTA1c/edit) by [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your distill site using CSS, check out these [slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-websites-css/#1).\n\n<aside>\n*Note: The following section was adapted from @apreshill2020postcards*\n</aside>\n\nNow that you have your distill site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the `distill::create_post()` function in your console:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n```\n\nIf this is the **first time** you are creating a blog post, `{distill}` will add a directory called `_posts/`, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a **listing page**, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank `.Rmd` file to your root directory by running `utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\")` in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n```\n\nFinally, link your new listing page to your website's navbar by editing **`_site.yml`**. *Note: Since I named my listing `.Rmd` file as `blog.Rmd`, the href I need to link to is `blog.html`.*\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Blog\"      # add \n      href: blog.html   # add\n```\n\n## IV. Customizing your distill blog & posts\n\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your distill blog. Here are some of the steps I followed to customize my first blog post. \n\n<aside>\n*Note: This section's content was largely adapted from @allaire2018distill*\n</aside>\n\n### i. Preview images\n\nPreview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"media/preview_img.png\")\n```\n\nAdd your image to the folder where your blog post `.Rmd` lives (e.g. `_posts` -> `YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post` -> `my_preview_image.jpeg`). Then, add the `preview` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image\n---\n```\n\n### ii. Categories\n\nYou can assign each post to one or more \"categories,\" making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the `categories` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to two catetories: `distill` and `R`:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\ncategories:\n  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like \n  - R \n---\n```\n\nTake a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post. \n\n### iii. Table of contents\n\nTable of contents can be helpful for readers to navigate longer posts. Add the `toc` (and optionally, `toc_float`) field to your blog's YAML header as shown below: \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)\n---\n```\n\n### iv. Citations\n\nYou can add automatically-generated citations to the bottom of your posts, making it easier for readers to reference your work. \n\nI did this by first adding the `base_url` field to my **`_site.yml`** and set the value to the landing page URL of my distill site. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\nname: \"samanthacsik.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Samantha Csik\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbase_url: samanthacsik.github.io # add your website's landing page url\n---\n```\n\nI then specified the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug) (the unique identifying part of a web address) in the YAML header of my blog post `.Rmd` file (a slug will be automatically generated if not provided):\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nslug: csik2021firstBlog\n---\n```\n\nYour citations will now appear as metadata at the bottom of your post upon knitting.\n\n### v. Bibliographies\n\nYou can use standard [R Markdown bibliographies](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) to cite works throughout your post and include a corresponding \"References\" list. You will first need to create a `.bib` file in the folder containing your blog post. You can do so by running the `file.edit()` function in your console. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\nfile.edit(\"_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/bibliography.bib\")\n```\n\nNext, add the `bibliograhy` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file and set the value to the name of your new `.bib` file:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\n```\n\nNow, add citation information to your `.bib` file. This is super easy if you are citing a distill article that has citation information already included -- just copy and paste! *Note: there are different formats (e.g. CSL or BibTeX) for creating bibliography files. I chose to use BibTeX.* \n\nFor example, @allaire2018distill includes the following BibTeX citation at the end of their post, which I have copied into my `.bib` file:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n@misc{allaire2018distill,\n  author = {Allaire, JJ and Iannone, Rich and Presmanes Hill, Alison and Xie, Yihui},\n  title = {Distill for R Markdown},\n  url = {https://rstudio.github.io/distill},\n  year = {2018}\n}\n```\n\nNote the format of this citation, where `type` can be `manual`, `book`, `article`, `misc`, etc. (all case-insensitive) and `key` is the citation reference used for inserting in-text citations.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n@type{key,\n  ...\n  }\n```\n\nTo include an in-text citation for the above reference, type `@allaire2018distill` (or if you prefer your citation to be inside parentheses, `[@allaire2018distill]`). Adding the in-text citation will automatically add the full reference to your \"References\" list at the bottom of your post. To read more about including bibliographies and citations in your blog posts, see @bookdown and @cookbook.\n\n### vi. Appendices\n\nWhile citations and references will be automatically added as appendices to your blog post (if you followed along with the steps above), you can add additional content here by adding the `.appendix` class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example, I added an additional \"Corrections\" statement to my appendix below by typing:\n\n`## Corrections {.appendix}`\n\n`If you see mistakes or want to suggest changes...`\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nI had a ton of fun playing around with some of these easy-to-implement features that the `{distill}` package provides for customizing blog posts. And I had even *more* fun checking out other data science blogs as I looked for inspiration. I hope they inspired you too! Happy blogging `r fontawesome::fa(\"smile-beam\", fill = \"#A58893\", a11y = \"sem\")`","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI am a total blog newb. \n\n*BUT* we all have to start somewhere.

For a very brief intro on customizing your distill site using CSS, check out these [slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-websites-css/#1).\n\n<aside>\n*Note: The following section was adapted from @apreshill2020postcards*\n</aside>\n\nNow that you have your distill site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the `distill::create_post()` function in your console:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n```\n\nIf this is the **first time** you are creating a blog post, `{distill}` will add a directory called `_posts/`, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a **listing page**, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank `.Rmd` file to your root directory by running `utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\")` in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n```\n\nFinally, link your new listing page to your website's navbar by editing **`_site.yml`**. *Note: Since I named my listing `.Rmd` file as `blog.Rmd`, the href I need to link to is `blog.html`.*\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Blog\"      # add \n      href: blog.html   # add\n```\n\n## IV. Customizing your distill blog & posts\n\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your distill blog. Here are some of the steps I followed to customize my first blog post. \n\n<aside>\n*Note: This section's content was largely adapted from @allaire2018distill*\n</aside>\n\n### i. Preview images\n\nPreview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"media/preview_img.png\")\n```\n\nAdd your image to the folder where your blog post `.Rmd` lives (e.g. `_posts` -> `YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post` -> `my_preview_image.jpeg`). Then, add the `preview` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image\n---\n```\n\n### ii. Categories\n\nYou can assign each post to one or more \"categories,\" making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the `categories` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to two catetories: `distill` and `R`:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\ncategories:\n  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like \n  - R \n---\n```\n\nTake a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post. \n\n### iii. Table of contents\n\nTable of contents can be helpful for readers to navigate longer posts. Add the `toc` (and optionally, `toc_float`) field to your blog's YAML header as shown below: \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)\n---\n```\n\n### iv. Citations\n\nYou can add automatically-generated citations to the bottom of your posts, making it easier for readers to reference your work. \n\nI did this by first adding the `base_url` field to my **`_site.yml`** and set the value to the landing page URL of my distill site. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\nname: \"samanthacsik.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Samantha Csik\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbase_url: samanthacsik.github.io # add your website's landing page url\n---\n```\n\nI then specified the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug) (the unique identifying part of a web address) in the YAML header of my blog post `.Rmd` file (a slug will be automatically generated if not provided):\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nslug: csik2021firstBlog\n---\n```\n\nYour citations will now appear as metadata at the bottom of your post upon knitting.\n\n### v. Bibliographies\n\nYou can use standard [R Markdown bibliographies](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) to cite works throughout your post and include a corresponding \"References\" list. You will first need to create a `.bib` file in the folder containing your blog post. You can do so by running the `file.edit()` function in your console. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\nfile.edit(\"_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/bibliography.bib\")\n```\n\nNext, add the `bibliograhy` field to the YAML header of your blog post `.Rmd` file and set the value to the name of your new `.bib` file:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\n```\n\nNow, add citation information to your `.bib` file. This is super easy if you are citing a distill article that has citation information already included -- just copy and paste! *Note: there are different formats (e.g. CSL or BibTeX) for creating bibliography files. I chose to use BibTeX.* \n\nFor example, @allaire2018distill includes the following BibTeX citation at the end of their post, which I have copied into my `.bib` file:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n@misc{allaire2018distill,\n  author = {Allaire, JJ and Iannone, Rich and Presmanes Hill, Alison and Xie, Yihui},\n  title = {Distill for R Markdown},\n  url = {https://rstudio.github.io/distill},\n  year = {2018}\n}\n```\n\nNote the format of this citation, where `type` can be `manual`, `book`, `article`, `misc`, etc. (all case-insensitive) and `key` is the citation reference used for inserting in-text citations.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\n@type{key,\n  ...\n  }\n```\n\nTo include an in-text citation for the above reference, type `@allaire2018distill` (or if you prefer your citation to be inside parentheses, `[@allaire2018distill]`). Adding the in-text citation will automatically add the full reference to your \"References\" list at the bottom of your post. To read more about including bibliographies and citations in your blog posts, see @bookdown and @cookbook.\n\n### vi. Appendices\n\nWhile citations and references will be automatically added as appendices to your blog post (if you followed along with the steps above), you can add additional content here by adding the `.appendix` class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example, I added an additional \"Corrections\" statement to my appendix below by typing:\n\n`## Corrections {.appendix}`\n\n`If you see mistakes or want to suggest changes...`\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nI had a ton of fun playing around with some of these easy-to-implement features that the `{distill}` package provides for customizing blog posts. And I had even *more* fun checking out other data science blogs as I looked for inspiration. I hope they inspired you too!
