    "text": "III. Adding a blog to your personal Quarto website\nTL;DR: A couple of steps are required for setting up your blog, but generally speaking, you’ll need:\nangle-right a folder (i.e. subdirectory) to hold all of your individual blog posts – I called my folder posts (though the name is up to you). I also (optionally) added a _metadata.yml file to this folder which includes some formatting and configuration options that will apply to all blog posts in this folder\nangle-right a listing page, which lists all of your blog posts for viewers to browse and click through – this is a .qmd file that you’ll add to your website’s navbar by including it in _quarto.yml\nangle-right blog posts! Your listing page will be blank until you actually add your first blog post\nLet’s create those together now.\n\nCreate a /posts folder: Open up your Quarto website project (I find it easiest to do this in RStudio) and make sure you’re in your root directory. Here, we’ll create a new subdirectory, called posts (you can call this whatever you want), where all of our blog posts will eventually live. To do so, you can either (a) click on the add folder button, , in the Files pane, or (b) in the RStudio Terminal, run mkdir posts.\nOptional: Add a _metadata.yml file to /posts: While not required, a _metadata.yml file can make your life easier if you want certain options to apply to all blog posts that you create. In the RStudio Terminal, run cd posts to move into that directory, then touch _metadata.yml to create the file. Open your _metadata.yml in the Source pane to add options. I like these options2, but it’s entirely up to you what you want to include (if anything at all):\n\n\n# options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder\n\n# prevents posts from re-rendering unless explicitly told to do so (for more, see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)\nfreeze: true\n\n# enable banner style title blocks (see https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html)\ntitle-block-banner: true\n\n\nCreate a listing page: A listing page is a page with content that is automatically generated from a list of documents – in this case, that would be a list of blog posts – and looks something like this (or check out my blog’s listing page here):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MEDS Community Blog listing page, with multiple blog posts arranged in the default-style layout – Quarto has multiple listing page layout options (default, grid, table) for you to explore\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a listing page, add a posts.qmd file to your root directory. First, click on the R Project icon, , in the Files pane to jump back to your project’s root directory. There are a bunch of ways to create a new .qmd file, but one easy way is to choose File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document…. Below, I give mine the title “My Blog” when prompted (this name appears at the top of your listing page), then saved it as posts.qmd (but you can choose whatever title and/or file name you’d like).\n\n\nConfigure your listing page: Specify how you’d like your listing page to be arranged by updating the YAML section of posts.qmd. There are a variety of options that you can specify. Below are just a few, but check out other options here:\n\n\ntitle: \"My Blog\"\nlisting: \n  contents: posts # all Quarto docs in the `posts` directory will be included on your listing page\n  type: grid # or `default` or `table`; each type has its own set of yaml options to include\n  sort: \"date desc\" # can also sort on more than one field\n  categories: true # allows you to sort posts by assigned categories \n\n\nAdd your listing page to your website’s navbar: Update _quarto.yml with your new listing page to add it to your site’s navbar:\n\n\n# ~ parts of `_quarto.yml` omitted for brevity ~\n\nwebsite:\n  navbar:\n    title: myWebsiteTitle\n    right:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: home\n      - about.qmd\n      - posts.qmd # add your posts.qmd file to your navbar!\n\n\nPreview or Render your website: Make sure your listing page shows up by previewing or rendering your website (you can do either of these from the Build tab in RStudio. You should have something that looks like this (we haven’t created any posts yet, so it’ll be empty for now):"

Both of these fields will appear on your listing page.\nYou can include more than one author – see this post and source code as an example.\nYou may include as many self-defined categories as you’d like. Make sure that your spelling/capitalization/punctuation is consistent across blog posts should you apply the same categories to multiple posts.\nAdding the citation option automatically generates both a BibTeX citation and reference for your blog post, and adds them to the bottom of your post.\nInclude an image (or gif) to add as a preview image, which will appear on your listing page alongside your post. Your image should live inside your post’s subdirectory (e.g. mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/preview-image.png).\nSet draft: true while you’re still working on your blog post to prevent it from showing up on your listing page, site map, or site search.

    "text": "V. Some additional authoring features to explore\nBlog posts are just Quarto documents, meaning you can combine prose, code, and embedded outputs all in one place, just like you would in any other .qmd file (which makes your blog the perfect place to create data science/programming tutorials both for yourself and others Winking Face). If you’re looking for additional ways to enhance your posts, read on below:\n\nAdding footnotes\nThere are multiple ways to include footnotes throughout your blog posts:\n\nUse the [^#] syntax to denote where you would like a note to be inserted. Write your note somewhere below following the [^#]: your note here syntax. For example:\n\n\nI am going to insert a footnote here[^1].\n\n[^1]: Here is the associated footnote, which will appear at the bottom of my document in a \"Footnotes\" section.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can write your notes inline to avoid having to use identifiers (e.g. [^#]). For example:\n\n\nI am going to insert an inline footnote here^[Here is my inline footnote].\n\n\nYou can also add footnotes that include multiple paragraphs. See the source code for this blog post and take a peek at footnote #2 for an example on how to do so (or check out the Quarto documentation).\n\nAll footnotes will appear in a “Footnotes” section that is automatically generated for you.\n\n\nCreating a bibliography and adding citations\nQuarto supports the use of bibliography files for citing works throughout your blog post. There are a number of ways to do this, but so far, I’ve found creating a BibLaTex database to be relatively straightforward. This database takes the form of a plain-text .bib file where we can store all of our bibliographic information. That information needs to be encoded in a particular way (more on that below). Follow these steps to cite works in your blog posts:\n\nFirst, create a .bib file in the folder containing your blog post (e.g. mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/references.bib) using the touch command in your RStudio Terminal. I called mine references.bib, but the name is up to you.\nTo use your references.bib file, you’ll need to add the bibliography option to your blog post’s YAML:\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"blog post title\"\n# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\nNext, we’ll want to add some references. These take a particular format that generally looks like this (the number/types of fields included may vary):\n\n\n@type{key,\n  author = {LastName, FirstName},\n  title = {Title of work},\n  date = {YYYY}\n  url = {https://url.com},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n\nwhere type can be manual, book, article, misc, etc. (all case-insensitive) and key is the citation identifier used for inserting in-text citations (we’ll get there soon).\n\nThere may be instances where you want to cite a resource that already has a BibTex citation available for you to copy over to your references.bib file (e.g. this blog post). For most resources, however, you’ll need to construct your own. You can do this manually, or with the help of a BibTeX reference generator (Googling will yield plenty of options, but zoterobib is a great place to start. Note that you may have to make some manual adjustments). Check out my references.bib file for this post as an example.\n\n\nNow that you have BibTex references in your .bib file, you can start adding in-text citations. These generally take the form [@key] (but read more about Quarto citation syntax here). When you add an in-text citation, Quarto will automatically add the reference to the bottom of your blog post under the “References” section.\n\n\nTo give one final concrete example, let’s say I want to cite my first (ever) blog post from last year. I can copy the BibTeX citation from the bottom of the post and paste it into my references.bib file:\n\n\n@online{csik2021,\n  author = {Samantha Csik},\n  title = {Why Create Presentation Slides about Blogging When You Can\n    Just Blog about It Instead?},\n  date = {2021-09-24},\n  url = {https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n\n\nI can now add an in-text citation using the [@csik2021] syntax here arrow-right (Csik 2021). Once cited, it will appear in my References section at the bottom of this post.\n\nThat wasn’t so bad, right?? What if I told you there was an even easier way to add citations….Start by popping over to RStudio’s Visual editor, if you’re not already there (you should see buttons for working in either the Source or Visual editor in the top left corner of your source pane), and follow the steps below:\n\nPlace your cursor where you’d like to insert a citation, then from the Insert drop down menu, select Citation.\nA new window will pop open with a number of different options for inserting citations. If you’ve already created a references.bib file, it will appear under the My Sources and Bibliography sections. You can choose any of your existing references to insert an in-text citation from or choose another option, like inserting a citation based on a DOI (!!! I can’t tell you how awesome I think this is !!!). Once you add an in-text citation based on a DOI, the BibTeX reference will automatically be added to your references.bib file, as well as to your references list at the bottom of your post. If you don’t yet have a references.bib file, one will automatically be generated for you. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? SO FREAKIN COOL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, back to being chill…\n\n\nArticle layout\nQuarto also supports a number of different page layout options to further customize the appearance of your posts. Explore different ways to position elements on your page, including embedding outputs, captions, references in your page margin (one of my personal faves…despite the fact that I don’t have any here in this post)."

    "text": "III. Adding a distill blog to your personal website\nDisclaimer: A lot of the following content (sections III & IV) is just a compilation of excellent existing resources. I learn by repeating things (usually many times), so taking the time to type out code/YAML headers has been helpful, albeit not at all novel. See a list of referenced resources at the bottom of this post.\nIf you have not yet made a distill site, there are many great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these step-by-step instructions by Allison Horst before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your distill site using CSS, check out these slides.\n\nNote: The following section was adapted from Hill (2020)\n\nNow that you have your distill site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the distill::create_post() function in your console:\n\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n\nIf this is the first time you are creating a blog post, {distill} will add a directory called _posts/, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a listing page, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank .Rmd file to your root directory by running utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\") in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n\nFinally, link your new listing page to your website’s navbar by editing _site.yml. Note: Since I named my listing .Rmd file as blog.Rmd, the href I need to link to is blog.html.\n\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Blog\"      # add \n      href: blog.html   # add"

    "section": "IV. Customizing your distill blog & posts",
    "text": "IV. Customizing your distill blog & posts\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your distill blog. Here are some of the steps I followed to customize my first blog post.\n\nNote: This section’s content was largely adapted from Allaire et al. (2018)\n\n\ni. Preview images\nPreview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your image to the folder where your blog post .Rmd lives (e.g. _posts -&gt; YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post -&gt; my_preview_image.jpeg). Then, add the preview field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image\n---\n\n\n\nii. Categories\nYou can assign each post to one or more “categories,” making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the categories field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to two catetories: distill and R:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\ncategories:\n  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like \n  - R \n---\n\nTake a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post.\n\n\niii. Table of contents\nTable of contents can be helpful for readers to navigate longer posts. Add the toc (and optionally, toc_float) field to your blog’s YAML header as shown below:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)\n---\n\n\n\niv. Citations\nYou can add automatically-generated citations to the bottom of your posts, making it easier for readers to reference your work.\nI did this by first adding the base_url field to my _site.yml and set the value to the landing page URL of my distill site. For example:\n\n---\nname: \"samanthacsik.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Samantha Csik\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbase_url: samanthacsik.github.io # add your website's landing page url\n---\n\nI then specified the slug (the unique identifying part of a web address) in the YAML header of my blog post .Rmd file (a slug will be automatically generated if not provided):\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nslug: csik2021firstBlog\n---\n\nYour citations will now appear as metadata at the bottom of your post upon knitting.\n\n\nv. Bibliographies\nYou can use standard R Markdown bibliographies to cite works throughout your post and include a corresponding “References” list. You will first need to create a .bib file in the folder containing your blog post. You can do so by running the file.edit() function in your console. For example:\n\nfile.edit(\"_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/bibliography.bib\")\n\nNext, add the bibliograhy field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your new .bib file:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\n\nNow, add citation information to your .bib file. This is super easy if you are citing a distill article that has citation information already included – just copy and paste! Note: there are different formats (e.g. CSL or BibTeX) for creating bibliography files. I chose to use BibTeX.\nFor example, Allaire et al. (2018) includes the following BibTeX citation at the end of their post, which I have copied into my .bib file:\n\n@misc{allaire2018distill,\n  author = {Allaire, JJ and Iannone, Rich and Presmanes Hill, Alison and Xie, Yihui},\n  title = {Distill for R Markdown},\n  url = {https://rstudio.github.io/distill},\n  year = {2018}\n}\n\nNote the format of this citation, where type can be manual, book, article, misc, etc. (all case-insensitive) and key is the citation reference used for inserting in-text citations.\n\n@type{key,\n  ...\n  }\n\nTo include an in-text citation for the above reference, type @allaire2018distill (or if you prefer your citation to be inside parentheses, [@allaire2018distill]). Adding the in-text citation will automatically add the full reference to your “References” list at the bottom of your post. To read more about including bibliographies and citations in your blog posts, see Xie (2021) and Xie, Dervieux, et Riederer (2021).\n\n\nvi. Appendices\nWhile citations and references will be automatically added as appendices to your blog post (if you followed along with the steps above), you can add additional content here by adding the .appendix class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example, I added an additional “Corrections” statement to my appendix below by typing:\n## Corrections {.appendix}\nIf you see mistakes or want to suggest changes...\n \nI had a ton of fun playing around with some of these easy-to-implement features that the {distill} package provides for customizing blog posts. And I had even more fun checking out other data science blogs as I looked for inspiration. I hope they inspired you too! Happy blogging Beaming Face With Smiling Eyes"

Taking an iterative approach to building out your code can help make this process clearer, less daunting, and more fun. In this workshop, we’ll use one case study to practice breaking down the function and for loop writing process into manageable, bite-sized steps."

Below is a heatmap of all my recorded activities made using leaflet. It’s challenging to see individual markers at my most frequented trail heads/starting points, so I’ve recently began building out my own Strava Dashboard (using {shinydashboard}) to make it a bit more interactive and filterable – it’s a work in progress, but a fun side project that I’m excited to continue iterating upon. Huge shout out to Daniel Cullen (who also happens to be a Santa Barbara resident!) for his awesome blogpost that got me started with my own map.\n\n\nFeel free to check out my Strava dashboard, Sam’s Strava Stats (still working on a better name…)!

    "text": "the logo\nI’m a proud Csik (pronounced “chick” – Hungarian, for the curious), though I spent many of my younger years embarrassed when people (understandably) got it wrong (variations include “sea-sick,” “sick,” “ca-sick,” to name a few) – and many of us know how brutal little kid peers can be when there’s a funny way to mispronounce a name. At some point, I learned to embrace the weird and it became very much a part of my everyday identity. My track coaches and teammates would shout “LET’S GO CSIK” during my events at meets, I signed year books as “Sam [drawing of a chick]” and every handmade card received my “The Csik Press” identifying mark on the back. As I’ve grown older, I’ve taken more care to help colleagues, peers, and strangers learn the correct pronunciation – because if I’m being totally honest, I think my name is pretty darn cool Face Smile Wink. So my first ever real logo is an homage to my earliest attempts at claiming my Csik identity. It may evolve a bit, but for now, it makes me pretty happy. Made using the (free!) Adobe Express logo maker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back of a handmade birthday card by yours truly (aka ‘The Csik Press’).

    "text": "Le logiciel R est un langage dédié à la statistique. Il a été développé à partir des années 90 à l’University of Auckland, Nouvelle-Zélande. Son implémentation principale est en open source (gratuit et modifiable) R : cran.r-project.org.\nR est un langage interprété (comme Python) et non compilé, c’est-à-dire que les commandes tapées au clavier sont directement exécutées sans avoir besoin de construire un programme complet. On dit également qu’il est “exécuté à la volée”. Par exemple, on peut à partir d’une ligne de commande écrire :\n\n\nprint('Hello world!')\n\n[1] \"Hello world!\"\n\nPour simplifier son utilisation, il est possible d’écrire des scripts c’est à dire une suite de commandes qui se trouvent dans un fichier dont l’extension est .R mais on pourrait tout aussi bien les écrire dans un .txt.\nPour simplifier l’utilisation de R, il est nécessaire d’avoir une interface graphique (appelée aussi GUI pour Graphic User Interfaces). Celle offerte par R est très simpliste et beaucoup préfèrent utiliser RStudio (www.rstudio.com) à juste titre. Cet outil permet de réellement fluidifier le travail avec ce langage.\n\n\n\nLa fenêtre de RStudio se divise généralement en quatre sous-fenêtres. En partant de haut à gauche et en les parcourant dans le sens horaire on trouve :\n\nun éditeur de texte pour les scripts\nl’espace de travail ou d’historique de commandes\nle navigateur de fichiers, graphiques, packages, documentations\nla console R, c’est à dire la ligne de commande ainsi que les résultats des exécutions du code.\n\n\nTypiquement, on tape le code dans l’éditeur (1) puis on l’exécute. il se retrouve alors dans console. Pour cela on place le curseur dans la ligne qu’on veut exécuter et on envoie la commande à la console à l’aide de la combinaison ⌘ + ⏎ dans IOS et Ctrl + ⏎ sous Windows ou tout simplement à l’aide de la commande Run.\n\n\n\nR dispose d’une documentation très complète et l’aide en ligne peut être très utile pour l’utilisation de fonctions, librairies et jeux de données. On peut accéder directement à l’aide en tapant ? suivi par la fonction (ou autre instruction, jeu de données,…) sur laquelle on souhaite se renseigner :\n?mean\naffichera par exemple la page d’aide pour la fonction mean(). La commande\nhelp(mean)\naura le même effet.\nOn peut aussi trouver énormément d’informations sur le web : par exemple en cherchant à l’aide d’un moteur de recherche un problème lié à une tâche R on trouve presque toujours une réponse (souvent dans des forum ouverts sur le site Cross Validated).\nLe but de cette introduction tutorielle est de vous apprendre l’utilisation élémentaire de R. Bien que les objets et commandes de bases y soient introduits, cette introduction n’est pas une référence complète au langage R (loin de là!), vous serez donc amenés à utiliser l’aide et à chercher des informations sur le web. A chaque étape, vous êtes encouragés à taper les commandes et à en comprendre le résultat : la meilleur façon d’apprendre un langage est d’écrire et débugger beaucoup de lignes de code!\n\n\n\nL’une des premières utilisation est la création d’objets1, qui seront mis en mémoire pour l’utilisation dans de futur fonctions ou codes. Un objet peut être créé en utilisant “l’assignation”. Il s’agit d’assigner à un objet (lettre, mot, …) une valeur à l’aide d’une flèche (&lt;-) ou avec le signe =. Je préconise cependant d’utiliser l’assigantion par la “flèche”, cela permet d’avoir un code plus propre et de pouvoir différencier l’assignation et le code en lui même. Une fois l’objet créé nous pouvons afficher son contenu en tapant le nom de l’objet.1 Les objets sont en général des vecteurs, matrices, listes …, auxquels nous appliqueront des fonctions\nExemple :\n\n\nn &lt;- (20 + 10)/5       # création de n et assignation du résultat de l'opération\n\nn                      # appel de l'objet n pour affichage de sa valeur\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstuce\n\n\n\nLe chiffre 1 entre crochets indique qu’il s’agit du premier élément d’une série de n valeurs. Dans l’exemple précedent, la série comprend 1 valeur.\n\n\nLe nom d’un objet doit obligatoirement commencer par une lettre. Il peut être suivi de chiffres, de points, d’espace soulignés (_). De plus, le langage R fait la distinction entre les majuscules et les minuscules : n et N pourront servir à nommer/créer 2 objets distincts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSi l’objet existe déja, sa valeur précédente est éffacée. C’est un annule et remplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nLes deux grands avantages de R est d’être gratuit et open source. De ce fait il jouit d’une communauté d’utilisateurs très active dans le monde scientifique (statistiques, science des données, bioinformatique, sciences sociales,…). Il est de plus très utilisé par la communauté scientifique et de plus en plus dans les entreprises.\nToute nouvelle méthode statistique a très rapidement une implémentation dans ce langage, ce qui n’est pas toujours le cas pour d’autres langages. Cela enrichi considérablement le logiciel et se fait à l’aide de ce qu’on appelle des paquets (ou packages ou library) Ces derniers sont développés par les utilisateurs et les développeurs. On peut les installer pour augmenter les capacités et possibilités du logiciel dans des domaines très variés de la statistique mais pas seulement en statistique. Il en existe un très grand nombre sur le site du CRAN : cran.r-project.org.\nPour installer un package:\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\") # avec guillemets!\nUne fois un package installé, il faudra le charger en mémoire à chaque fois qu’une nouvelle session est ouverte:\nlibrary(dplyr) # sans guillemets!\nrequire(dplyr) # fonction équivalente\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstuce\n\n\n\nLe # sert à commenter les instructions. Le texte/code situé après # (sur la même ligne) ne sera pas éxécuté, ce sera juste un commentaire.\n\n\nAsides allow you to place content objet from the content it is placed in. Asides look like footnotes, but do not include the footnote mark (the superscript number). This is a span that has the class objet which places it in the margin without a footnote number."

Par exemple, on peut à partir d’une ligne de commande écrire :\n\n\nprint('Hello world!')\n\n[1] \"Hello world!\"\n\nPour simplifier son utilisation, il est possible d’écrire des scripts c’est à dire une suite de commandes qui se trouvent dans un fichier dont l’extension est .R mais on pourrait tout aussi bien les écrire dans un .txt.\nPour simplifier l’utilisation de R, il est nécessaire d’avoir une interface graphique (appelée aussi GUI pour Graphic User Interfaces). Celle offerte par R est très simpliste et beaucoup préfèrent utiliser RStudio (www.rstudio.com) à juste titre. Cet outil permet de réellement fluidifier le travail avec ce langage."

Ce package propose un grand nombre de fonctions permettant de personnaliser finement les représentations graphiques. Cette fiche n’est donc qu’une introduction succincte à ggplot2. Pour des formations plus détaillées, se référer à {#ggplot2Ressources}.\n\nIntroduction\nLa fonction essentielle de ggplot2 est ggplot(). Il faut définir quatre éléments pour construire un graphique avec ggplot():\n\nla table de données ;\nle mapping : on définit dans l’aesthetic (ou aes) le lien entre les variables des données et ce que l’on veut représenter sur le graphique (quelle variable sur l’axe x, sur l’axe y, quelle variable pour définir une graduation de couleurs…) ;\nla forme géométrique ou geometry  : on définit la représentation graphique qu’on souhaite utiliser. Les géométries ont toutes un nom qui commence par geom_; par exemple, il faut utiliser la géométrie geom_point() pour réaliser un nuage de points;\nles paramètres : on définit les autres paramètres qui dépendent de constantes (par exemple : je veux que toutes mes lignes soient rouges ou de taille 2 pixels).\n\nLa construction d’un graphique repose sur le principe de couches successives. Les différentes couches graphiques se superposent et s’enchaînent grâce à l’opérateur +, comme un pipe. Il est possible d’aller à la ligne dans une instruction ggplot(), il suffit que l’opérateur + figure à la fin de la ligne.\nVoici un exemple de code qui crée un nuage de points (géométrie geom_point()) à partir des données mes_donnees, avec les variables variable1 en abscisse et variable2 en ordonnée:\n\n\nSe mettre d’accord sur la trame qui sera le squelette du rapport\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = iris) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width))\n## Warning: Use of `iris$Sepal.Length` is discouraged. Use `Sepal.Length` instead.\n## Warning: Use of `iris$Sepal.Width` is discouraged. Use `Sepal.Width` instead.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = iris) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width))\n\n\nLe mapping et l’utilisation d’aes()\nLe mapping désigne dans ggplot2 la relation entre un attribut graphique de la geometry (abscisse, ordonnée, couleur…) et une variable présente dans la table de données. On déclare le mapping grâce à la fonction aes() (pour aesthetic), qui sert donc à identifier les variables que l’on souhaite représenter sur le graphique.\nLes arguments fondamentaux de aes() sont les variables représentées sur l’axe des abscisses et l’axe des ordonnées (x et y). Par exemple, on écrit aes(x = niveau_vie_median, y = taux_chomage) si l’on souhaite représenter pour chaque iris le taux de chômage (sur l’axe y) en fonction du niveau de vie médian (sur l’axe x).\nPar ailleurs, la fonction aes() admet d’autres arguments qui permettent de modifier l’apparence des attributs graphiques selon une troisième variable du jeu de données. Voici les arguments supplémentaires les plus courants:\n\n\n\nAttribut\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncolor\nCouleur des lignes ou des points\n\n\nshape\nForme des points\n\n\nsize\nTaille des points\n\n\nalpha\nTransparence des points\n\n\nfill\nCouleur des surfaces\n\n\nlinetype\nType de ligne (continue, pointillée, …)\n\n\n\nDans l’exemple qui suit, on représente pour chaque iris le taux de chômage (sur l’axe y) en fonction du niveau de vie médian (sur l’axe x), en colorant les points en fonction de la part des cadres et professions intellectuelles supérieures parmi les actifs de l’iris (color = part_cadres).\nIl est également possible d’utiliser ces mêmes arguments pour modifier un attribut graphique sans le lier à une variable. En ce cas, on définit l’attribut à l’extérieur de l’aesthetic (donc à l’extérieur de aes()). Voici l’exemple précédent, modifié pour que tous les points soient (rouge), et non en fonction d’une variable. L’argument color est donc à l’extérieur de aes().\n\nLa notion de mapping et la définition des attributs graphiques à l’intérieur et à l’extérieur d’aes() sont une des principales difficultés de ggplot2. Il est normal de tâtonner lorsqu’on commence à les utiliser. Pour s’y retrouver, il suffit de suivre la règle suivante. Si on établit un lien entre les valeurs d’une variable et un attribut graphique, il s’agit d’un mapping qui doit être défini à l’intérieur de la fonction aes(). Dans le cas contraire, il s’agit d’un simple paramètre du graphique, qui doit être défini à l’extérieur de la fonction aes().\n\n\n\nLes formes géométriques\nLa forme géométrique ou geometry désigne le type de représentation graphique utilisée (nuage de points, histogrammes…). On spécifie le type de représentation que l’on souhait en utilisant une fonction dont le nom commence par geom_. Le tableau ci-dessous présente quelques représentations graphiques classiques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\nDescription\nArguments\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point()\nNuage de points\nx, y, shape, fill, size\n\n\ngeom_line()\nLigne\nx, y, linetype\n\n\ngeom_bar()\nDiagramme en barres\nx, fill, linetype, weight\n\n\ngeom_histogram()\nHistogramme\nx, fill, linetype, weight\n\n\ngeom_boxplot()\nBoîte à moustaches\nx, y, fill, weight\n\n\ngeom_density()\nCourbe de densité\nx, y, fill, color, linetype\n\n\n\nVoici deux exemples d’utilisation.\n\nIl existe un grand nombre de géométries dans ggplot2. Vous pouvez en afficher la liste en exécutant la commande help.search(\"^geom_\", package = \"ggplot2\").\nPar ailleurs, de très nombreux packages proposent encore d’autres géométries pour réaliser des représentations graphiques particulières (cartes avec ggmap, arbres généalogiques avec ggtree et ggenealogy, résultats d’élections avec ggparliament…)."

In this 2 day workshop you will learn about the Quarto format for technical communication and computation. The workshop will teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of RStudio’s Visual Editor which provides a user interface for editing all of Pandoc markdown. The workshop will also provide an overview of Quarto’s developer tooling support in alternative tools such as Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors. The workshop will briefly cover how to add interactivity to Quarto with Shiny, Observable JS, htmlwidgets or Jupyter Widgets. Lastly, the workshop will cover Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as complex web sites or entire books. Presented by Tom Mock, Customer Enablement Lead at RStudio, this workshop will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these questions:\n\nHave you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your code, documentation, and outputs in a cohesive “data product”?\nDo you want to learn about the next generation of RMarkdown for data science?\nDo you want to have a better interactive experience when writing technical or scientific documents with literate programming?\n\nFind out more about this workshop and register at https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/get-started-quarto/.\nFrom R Markdown to Quarto: This workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills and expertise and apply them in Quarto. In this workshop you will learn how to apply your reproducible authoring skills to the Quarto format and learn about new tools and workflows for authoring with Quarto in RStudio. You will learn to create static documents, to add interactivity to them with Shiny and htmlwidgets, and to create presentations in various formats such as reveal.js, beamer, and pptx. The workshop will also introduce you to Quarto projects which you can use to build websites and write blogs and books. Finally, you will learn various ways to deploy and publish your Quarto projects on the web. Independent modules will also highlight authoring in Quarto with Jupyter and VS Code as well as other text editors. Presented by Andrew Bray, Associate Teaching Professor in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, this workshop will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to any of these questions:\n\nHave you authored R Markdown documents and are you interested in migrating your workflow to its successor format, Quarto?\nAre you interested in exploring the wide spectrum of documents that can be produced with Quarto, including static documents, websites, and slides?\n\nFind out more about this workshop and register at https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/rmd-to-quarto."

Lastly, I’ll cover what this means for our customers using RStudio Team, and the exciting new world for Python users.\n\nThese are a few of my favorite things (about Quarto presentations): (Talk recording)\n\nPresented by Tracy Teal, Open Source Program Director at RStudio.\nThursday July 28, 2022 3:20pm - 3:40pm EDT.\nQuarto is the next generation of RMarkdown, and comes with a new presentation format, revealjs. In this talk, I’ll show a few of my favorite things about making interactive HTML presentations with Quarto. Along the way you’ll learn about the visual editor, multiple columns, delivering an effective talk with speaker notes and mode, making your presentations pop with transitions, effective ways to incorporate code into your presentation, beautiful themes (and how to match your corporate style guide), and sharing it as pdf and HTML. I’ll finish off with a brief look at generating a PowerPoint presentation from a template.\n\nLiterate Programming With Jupyter Notebooks and Quarto: (Talk recording)\n\nPresented by Hamel Husain, head of Data Science at Outerbounds (the developers of Metaflow) and core developer at fast.ai.\nThursday July 28, 3:40pm - 4:00pm EDT.\nJupyter Notebooks play a critical role in in the workflow of many users. Notebooks are used to document existing code, to quickly prototype and iterate on ideas, and as a medium of technical communication. However, package developers typically use an entirely separate set of more traditional development tools, and the context switching between these tools and notebooks can be frustrating. Not only do you lose the ability to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and tests separately from source code. Nbdev is a literate programming framework that allows you to develop Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks. This talk will describe the integration between Nbdev and Quarto, which enables library developers to author their documentation right alongside their code, and automatically produce a Quarto website for their package. The result is a seamless workflow for developing, documenting, and testing software packages all within Jupyter Notebooks, with no context-switching required.\n\nWebsites & Books & Blogs, oh my! Creating Rich Content with Quarto: (Talk recording)\n\nPresented by Devin Pastoor, Solutions Engineer at RStudio.\nThursday July 28, 4:00pm - 4:20pm EDT.\nA number of packages have emerged in the R ecosystem to help create websites (hugodown), books (bookdown), and blogs (blogdown). In this talk, I’ll show you how Quarto handles creating these types of content and more. Whether you’re a grad student considering your first blog post about R, or a python expert about to write a technical book, I’ll show you how Quarto enables you to focus on content while it takes care of the rest. In addition, I’ll show the RStudio team is making it as easy as possible to publish and share content within your organization and to the whole community.\n\n\nTo find out more about the conference and register, visit rstd.io/conf. Looking forward to seeing you in DC!\nCan’t make it to the conference in person, but don’t want to miss this content? You can follow along with the talks remotely via the live stream and we will share materials from the workshops in a post-conf roundup post."

This makes it possible to add interactivity to your documents with just Python code. For example, you can include an interactive Shiny application like this, directly inside your Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case you’re not already familiar with Shiny, here’s some background: Shiny is a framework for creating web applications. Shiny was originally just for R, but we’ve recently released an alpha version of Shiny for Python.\nOne of the exciting new features of Shiny for Python is a deployment method called Shinylive: the application can be run entirely within the browser, without needing a remote server running Python. Instead, Python runs in the web browser, thanks to the magic of WebAssembly. In essence, but the server and client sides of the Shiny application run in the browser.\nThe Shiny for Python website contains many interactive, editable Shiny applications, and is built using this extension.\nBear in mind that not all Shiny applications can be deployed with Shinylive, in part because not all Python packages can run in WebAssembly – but for those that can, this extension makes it possible to deploy the Quarto document with the embedded application on any web hosting service. To learn more about Shinylive, see this page.\nThe new Shinylive Quarto extension makes it easy to embed Shiny for Python applications in Quarto documents. This is a great way of adding interactive components to your Quarto document. And, once again, you don’t need a server running Python to share these Quarto documents – just deploy the generated files as you would for any other Quarto website."

    "text": "Quarto Extensions are a powerful way to modify or extend the behavior of Quarto, and can be created and distributed by anyone. There are three types of extensions available:\n\nShortcodes are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. For example, you could create shortcodes to embed tweets or videos in a document.\nFilters are a flexible and powerful tool for introducing new global behaviors and/or new markdown rendering behaviors. For example, you could create filters to implement output folding, an image carousel, or just about anything you can imagine!\nFormats enable you to create new output formats by bundling together document options, templates, stylesheets, and other content.\n\nExtensions are a recently released Quarto feature so you should be sure to install the very latest version of Quarto (at least v1.0.36) if you want to try them out.\nHere are some examples of extensions developed and maintained by the core Quarto team:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlightbox\nCreate lightbox treatments for images in your HTML documents.\n\n\nfancy-text\nOutput nicely formatted versions of fancy strings such as LaTeX and BibTeX in multiple formats.\n\n\nfontawesome\nUse Font Awesome icons in HTML and PDF documents.\n\n\nlatex-environment\nQuarto extension to output custom LaTeX environments.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about using extensions, see the Extensions documentation on the Quarto website.
